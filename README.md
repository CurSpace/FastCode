# FastCode

Everyone relies on computing systems that perform matrix operations to get their daily tasks done.
Matrix vector multiplication is a key component in Neural Networks that power application in our devices.
We will experiment with the performance of matrix-vector multiplication with and without TACO(The Tensor Algebra Compiler) and the performance of a similar matrix-vector multiplication in the context of a simple Neural Network.
